# TensorOperators package

The Tensor Layers package contains building blocks for neural network machine learning algorithms.
It follows many other packages (like torch7) by defining:

- Layers
- Cost
- Optimization methods

The package is built with genericity (switch between CPU, Cuda and OpenCL) and speed in mind.

## Handling devices
