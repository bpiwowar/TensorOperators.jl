# Common functions

## Initializing the gradient

The generic method `init_gradient!` is used to initialize the


# Layers

- [Containers](containers.md) allow to combine the different modules (e.g. a sequence of modules to build a neural network)
- [Linear modules](linear.md) compute a linear function of their inputs. This include convolution, etc.
- [Transfer functions](transfer.md) transform each input with a given function
- [Classification](classification.md) are used to classify the output in a given number of categories
